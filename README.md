# musslanbeertime

musslanbeertime is used to see the current time in ISO-B33R format. Which is a binary (true/false) time format that indicates if it's beer time or not at work.
If beertime is false it will also return number of nanoseconds to next true event.
You also get the Universal Beer Constant. This constant is however not totally constant - just as the magnetic poles of the earth can switch - so can the beer constant.
When that happens the beer time will switch weeks between odd and even weeks. So be aware!
